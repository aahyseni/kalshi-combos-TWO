"""Book-risk within-game correlation provider, built the PRICER's way.

The portfolio-risk MC (``sim/book_model.build_book_model``) needs a
``WithinGameRhoProvider`` — a function ``(ticker_a, ticker_b) -> (low, point,
high) | None`` — to fill each within-game block of its global correlation matrix.
Without one it falls back to the flat ``DEFAULT_FLAT_BAND`` (a mild positive with
a wide band), which is BLIND to the real per-pair structure the pricer quotes on
(a same-game 2-leg book would show a flat tail, not the correlated tail the pricer
actually carries).

This module builds that provider from the SHIPPED ``SgpParams`` (the engine's own
``engine.sgp_params``) by calling the pricer's REAL ``build_sgp_correlation`` on
the two tickers as a synthetic 2-leg same-event pair, then reading the off-diagonal
of its (low, point, high) matrices. Hard rule 8: this REUSES the exact function the
pricer calls to build a combo's correlation — it never hardcodes or reimplements a
rho. A pair the pricer would type UNKNOWN falls through to ``build_sgp_correlation``'s
own flat fallback band (the fail-safe positive-with-negative-reach band), which the
provider returns like any other — so the risk view widens on an untyped pair exactly
as the pricer does.

Orientation note: ``build_sgp_correlation`` resolves marginal-DEPENDENT priors
(fav/dog moneyline curves, etc.) only when marginals are supplied; the whole-book
risk view has no single marginal per pair, so this provider calls it WITHOUT
marginals — the plain (marginal-less) entry applies, which is the pricer's own
fallback for a marginal-less caller and carries the conservative band. That is the
correct book-level summary: a per-combo exact orientation is the pricer's job at
quote time; the risk MC wants one conservative constant per within-game block
(book_model already takes the most-positive band member per block for ``high``).
