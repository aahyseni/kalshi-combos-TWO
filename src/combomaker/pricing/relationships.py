"""Logical relationship classifier for combo legs.

v1 detects, per quiet-failure defense #2, with an explicit UNKNOWN branch that
the caller must turn into widen-or-no-quote:

- IMPOSSIBLE: same market on both sides, or two YES legs of an event Kalshi
  marks mutually exclusive. v1 policy is NO-QUOTE on impossible combos (not
  "quote the arb"): if our classification were wrong, a confident quote on a
  "logically impossible" combo is exactly the trap takers hunt for. Scalar
  settlement (DNP etc.) can also make binary logic wrong — another reason not
  to be clever here.
- SAME_EVENT groups: legs sharing an event_ticker form correlation blocks for
  the copula; implication/nesting inside a group is NOT explicitly modeled in
  v1 — it is approximated by the block correlation and must be paid for with
  the correlation-uncertainty width adder.
- UNKNOWN: any leg whose event metadata (or mutual-exclusivity flag) we don't
  have. Never defaults to independence — that's the fail-safe inversion that
  gets farmed by same-game-parlay sharps.
